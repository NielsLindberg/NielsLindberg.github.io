# Udacity Project, Neighboorhood map

# Purpose
The purpose of this site was to do a nieghboorhood map, that I could share with my fellow international students
at my masters program who just moved to copenhagen. The site should list my favourite places and how they get there
with public transportation from our IT campus. The sites should also include a streetview functionality aswell as some basic yelp information on the locations if applicable.

# View site

# Credits
I've used various google maps services in this site aswell as the knockout.js framework, jquery, oauth-signature, and data from Yelp.com through their API.
